    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
      Previously, I was an Assistant Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at UC Berkeley following my time as a Stein Fellow in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University. 
      I obtained my PhD in Biostatistics from Harvard University, advised by Prof. Xihong Lin.</p>
<p>I am generally interested in understanding broad aspects of causal inference in observational studies
  in modern data settings, with a focus on learning about fundamental challenges in the statistical analysis of
  environmental mixtures and their effects on the cognitive development of children and cognitive decline in aging populations.
  My research is also motivated by learning through applications in large-scale genetic association studies, 
  developing statistical methods to quantify the effects of climate change on human health, and understanding 
  the effects of homelessness on human health.
